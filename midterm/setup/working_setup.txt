Trying to remember what I did to set up my working midterm directory.

I thought I had saved these commands. But in the adjacent git_hist.txt, NewSequence.txt, and Pull_Sequence.txt, I have only fragments of what I thought I'd done. There's no indication of how I hooked up my working copy to the remote at nird.us.

Here's what was in the midterm questions:

Instructions for Mid-Term submission and Git Review (10pts):
 - Create a git repository for your answers
 - Add and Commit as you work through the questions and programming problems
 - Your git log should reflect your work, don't just commit after you have finished working
 - Use .gitignore to ignore any files that are not relevant to the midterm
 - E-mail me your ssh public key
 - I will email you back with your repository name
 - Add a remote to your git repository: git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/YOURREPOSITORYNAME.git
 - Push your changes to the remote
 - After 6pm Tuesday November 13th you will not be able to push to your remote repository (or clone).

Renee needed my ssh public key. Found this at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Contents in full:

Sent that to her in the body of an email, and also as an attachment since I wasn't sure if it would go through in the message body.

I know I did this (from looking at git_hist.txt)

* Initialized a new local repository:

%> git init Midterm_Working

* Copy over the .rvmrc and .gitignore from other working repositories

%> cd Midterm_Working
%> cp ../RubyFall2012_Midterm/.gitignore .
%> cp ../RubyFall2012_Midterm/.rvmrc .

* Copy over some files I'd already created. Any means of getting working files in here will do.

%> cp -r ../RubyFall2012_Midterm/mid_term .

* Check the git status, add my working files, and do a commit:

%> git status
%> git add .
%> git status
%> git commit -m "Created midterm working directory"

* Renee created a remote directory for each person in class. Mine was:

  git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/Peter.git

And that's where it got interesting. Because I didn't save the commands that I used to connect to it. Or I did, and somehow lost them again.

* I think I did this:

%> git remote add renee_remote git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/Peter.git

* I had problems at that point, because Git doesn't know how to keep track of which branch a repository is on; it gets confused and thinks you're on several at once. Try some things like this:

%> git remote -v
renee_remote	git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/Peter.git (fetch)
renee_remote	git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/Peter.git (push)

%> git checkout master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from renee_remote.
Already on 'master'

%> git branch -a
* master
  remotes/renee_remote/master

* If I can get to the point where I see that remote, then I should be able to do:

%> git push renee_remote master

That'll probably ask me for my credentials each time (evac156, avalanche1) because that's what's needed for the ssh key.

And then, I can do a test pull, as shown in Pull_Sequence.txt
